Implementation of algorithm for 'Inferential modeling of 3D genome organization'
Commandline Readme
November 19, 2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
INSTALLATION
Put all the MATLAB script files in your MATLAB path. 

USAGE
Directly run the m-file ** ChrMod_main.m ** in the directory. 
Example: do the following at the MATLAB command window:  

    >> ChrMod_main(5,100)

Here we got two parameters, the first one decides which chromosome you modeled and 
the second one sets the volume of the ensemble. In example above, we are creating a
100-element ensemble for the spatial structure of chromosome #5. The concept of en-
semble is depicted in paper 'Inferential modeling of 3D genome organization', publ-
ished on ***.
It is important that you copy all the script file in the directory. 

INPUT
We used **interactions_HindIII_fdr0.0001_intra.txt** file as input. These data was 
generated by Duan et al. (http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/yeast-architecture/)

OUTPUT
The output is automatically saved in mat-file format, named by two input parameters
linked together. All variables of the modeling process is stored at the same time.
The variable 'Ensemble' is the spatial structure information, with its first dimen
-sion corresponds to each single elements in ensemble, and latter two dimension re-
presents the 3D coordinates of the end points of segments of chromosome.

NOTES
- This software was developed and tested on MATLAB R2012b and Windows7 operating s-
ystems. We tested it on linux servers as well.

PROBLEMS
If you encounter any difficulties while using it, please do not hesitate to contact 
us.
